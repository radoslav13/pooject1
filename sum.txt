1. Open command prompt menu 
2. type java -version and press egkd flfkdfldkfldfkdl.
3. In my case the java vession did not appear on the console so I had to change the path to the program from my computer/properties/advanced system settings.
4. Then I wrote cd and the location where my program is situated.
5. After that compiled the problem with: javac the name of the file and adding (SumOfNumbers).java at the end.
Finally I typed java and the name of the program - SumOfNumbers. After that I typed the two numbers on the console and then the program printed the result on the console.



Andn now what?




Did it work??

I did add the program creating PDFs to a jar file but I could not start it with command prompt, so I haven't uploaded that.
